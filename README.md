# _Porfolio Landing Page_

#### By _**Scott Hutley**_

## Technologies Used

* _html_
* _css_
* _bootstrap_
* _markdown_

## Description

_This is a page that allows for some quick referencing to projects I've created during my time at Epicodus, as opposed to directing someone to my entire GitHub repository. It's designed for easy additions/updates to be made as I see fit._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to an empty folder or to your desktop. Instructions for cloning can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
* Navigate to the index.html file and open with your web browser.

## Known Bugs

* No known bugs at this time. There is however a dummy column in the first row that I have left within the code for (potential) later use.
