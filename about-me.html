      <p>I'll try to keep this relatively simple. I was born and raised in Albany, Oregon and have spent my entire life somewhere along the west coast. In my youth I participated in all the standard Pacific Northwest activities; camping, hiking, snowboarding, etc. I grew up right as personal computers and the internet were beginning to take hold. As a result I developed a tremendous love for computer gaming. Unfortunately, furthering my education beyond high school wasn't a viable opportunity for me. Instead I entered the workforce where I spent a number of years as a warehouse worker for Target. Later I moved into production as a machine operator at International Paper.</p>
      <p>I've now decided I'm ready for yet another new challenge, which in turn has led me to Epicodus and their programming courses. My main objectives are essentially:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Finish the C# and React course at Epicodus.</li>
        <li>Secure and internship and/or job in a relevant field.</li>
        <li>Continue to grow as a coder and/or developer.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>All the while, I plan on still enjoying life and taking in as much of the Pacific Northwest has to offer. And, if miracles exist, MAYBE get to see Tool in concert just one more time.</p>
